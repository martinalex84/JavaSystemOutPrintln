# JavaSystemOutPrintln
Simple Library to print Java array, lists etc to the console

This is for the purposes on learning how to use git hub and for developing skills in creating static libraries.

This library is something I sometimes use when developing programmes in Java.
It will print to the console (with or without line numbers) the elements of an Array or List.
